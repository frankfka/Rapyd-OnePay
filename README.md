# Rapyd-OnePay

**Mobile**
The `mobile/` directory hosts a React Native application for the Rapyd OnePay demo. It is bootstrapped with [Expo](https://expo.io/).

**Web (REST API)**
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project serving as a REST API for the Rapyd OnePay
mobile app. It is currently hosted on Vercel.

To run the project locally, create a `.env` file in the root of `web/`, with the following keys:
`RAPYD_ACCESS_KEY`, `RAPYD_SECRET_KEY`.
